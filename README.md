This repository contains five machine learning projects demonstrating various predictive modeling techniques. Each project includes a Jupyter Notebook detailing data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Car Ownership Prediction
- **Objective:** Predict whether an individual owns a car based on demographic and socio-economic features.
- **Techniques Used:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest.
- **Dataset:** Contains demographic attributes such as age, income, and household size.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.

### 2. Disneyland Branch Classification
- **Objective:** Classify customer reviews to identify which Disneyland branch they belong to.
- **Techniques Used:** Natural Language Processing (NLP), TF-IDF, Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- **Dataset:** Customer reviews from multiple Disneyland branches.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision-Recall.

### 3. MSRP Prediction
- **Objective:** Predict the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of vehicles based on various features.
- **Techniques Used:** Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, XGBoost.
- **Dataset:** Vehicle specifications such as engine type, horsepower, mileage, and brand.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared.

### 4. Popularity Prediction
- **Objective:** Predict the popularity score of content or products based on historical interaction data.
- **Techniques Used:** Regression models, Neural Networks, Feature Engineering.
- **Dataset:** User interaction metrics, engagement data.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** R-squared, RMSE, MAPE.

### 5. Car Fuel Efficiency Prediction
- **Objective:** Estimate the fuel efficiency (miles per gallon) of a vehicle based on its characteristics.
- **Techniques Used:** Multiple Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting.
- **Dataset:** Contains vehicle attributes such as weight, engine size, and fuel type.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** RMSE, MAE, R-squared.
